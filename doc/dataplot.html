    <h2>dataplot, a viewer for electrical data</h2> 

    The dataplot application aims to become a versatile data viewer
    moslty designed for electronic developers. The application is
    written with python using gtk widgets. The application heavily
    relies on matplotlib for plotting and numpy for all data.

    <h3>design overview</h3>
    The application is splitted into the following main parts:
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>datatree</b> on the left side stores all the different datasources.</li>
      <li>The <b>plottree</b> holds all informations about how to plot some of the data.</li>
      <li>The <b>plotnotebook</b> displays the plots with matplotlib.</li>
      <li>And on the bottom of the application there's a logging notebook for infos, ...</li>
    </ul>
    There's a one to one relationship between the plottree and the
    plotnotebook. Where the first level refers the tabs of the
    notebook. The second level can hold some subplots (not
    implemented yet). The third holds the x-axis data and the 4th
    holds the y-axis data. <p></p>

    <h3>datatree and datasource plugins</h3>
    The datatree is a representation for all opened datasources. It can have the following entry types:
    <ul>
      <li><b>datasource objects</b> that represent a single datasource</li>
      <li><b>folder elements</b> are used to create a tree like structure</li>
      <li><b>array elements</b> with one to three dimensions</li>
      <li><b>table elements</b> where a table has several named 1-dimentional data arrays</li>
    </ul>
    A datasource is opened with the data menu that contains an entry for each available datasource plugin.
    A datasource plugin has a fixed interface that can load data files, return the tree structure of the
    given dataset and has some access functions to get the data from a specific data element.<p></p>
    
    The currently available datasource plugins are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>ngspice</b> binary and ascii files</li>
      <li><b>gnucap</b> ascii tables</li>
      <li><b>touchstone</b> s-parameter files</li>
      <li><b>hdf5</b> a small subset of hierarchical data format files</li>
    </ul>

    When activating (double-clicking) an array with 2 or 3 dimensions,
    you can select a single 1d-array with the following dialog: <p></p>

    <img alt="array selection dialog" src="bitmaps/dialog_arrayselection.png"> <p></p>

    The dialog just generates one or more slices of the selected data
    that would be generated with the array operator like "data[:,2]"
    or data[2,2,:] with python.  You can select one vector as
    x-data and one or more as y-data.  Accepting the input of the
    dialog will add the selected vectors to the current plot. <p></p>

    When activating an table entry you can select one column of the data as x-data and
    one or more as y-data.
    If you select no x-data, a generic x-data vector will be used.<p></p>
  
    <img alt="table selection dialog" src="bitmaps/dialog_tableselection.png"> <p></p>

    The selected vectors are stored as references to the datasource
    with the three variables datasource, path, slicer. The path refers
    the interal location inside the datasource. The slicer either
    contains the column name for tables and a slicing description for
    arrays.

    <h3>plottree and plotting</h3> 

    The options for a current subplot can be set with a dialog. It is
    opened when activating the subplot node. <p></p>

    Basic scrolling and paning can be done with the mouse wheel.

    <h2>development and source code</h2>
    This small application is currently under development. If you like to play with it you can get the source
    from the git repository <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/dataplot.git">http://repo.or.cz/w/dataplot.git</a>.

    <h3>todo</h3>
    Here's a list of features that I plan to code:
    <ul>
      <li>more zooming, paning modes with toolbar icons</li>
      <li>more than one subplots inside of each plot notebook</li>
      <li>color and style options for the lines</li>
      <li>handling of 1d-arrays</li>
      <li>operators for simple data manipulations (abs, imag, real, angle, invert, ...)</li>
      <li>reload of datasources (handle missing files, missing data, ...)</li>
      <li>paranoid error checking for every operation</li>
      <li>error and message logging</li>
      <li>cursors and markers</li>
      <li>dbus interface</li>
      <li>printing and exporting</li>
    </ul>
